# Sign-in Flow Rework Task

## Overview
Transform the current redirect-based sign-in flow to a modal-based approach that allows anonymous users to try the product before signing up, following the provided user flow blueprint.

## IMPORTANT UPDATE: No Database Migration Approach
Due to past migration issues, we're implementing this WITHOUT schema changes by using a special "anonymous" user account.

## Current State
- Landing page has "Sign In" button that redirects to `/sign-in` page
- All summary creation requires authentication (`protectedProcedure`)
- Clerk handles authentication with dedicated sign-in/sign-up pages
- After auth, users redirect to `/library`

## Target State (from Blueprint)
1. Anonymous user hits landing page
2. User can paste YouTube URL without authentication
3. Summary is created and shown immediately (anonymous)
4. After viewing summary, user is prompted to sign up to save it
5. Sign-in/up happens in modal (no page redirect)
6. After auth, anonymous summary is claimed and user goes to library

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. ✅ Create SignInModal component with Clerk integration
2. ✅ Create AuthPromptModal for post-summary sign-up prompts
3. ⚠️ Add anonymous summary creation tRPC procedure (started, has type errors)
4. Add session tracking for anonymous users
5. Update middleware to allow anonymous access

### Phase 2: Frontend Updates
1. Update landing page to use modal instead of redirect
2. Enhance URLInput component to handle anonymous flow
3. Update useAuth hook with modal management
4. Add session ID generation and tracking

### Phase 3: Backend Updates
1. Fix type errors in anonymous summary creation
2. Add summary ownership transfer procedure
3. Add anonymous summary retrieval procedure
4. Update database schema to support nullable userId

### Phase 4: Integration
1. Connect all components together
2. Test anonymous → authenticated flow
3. Add cleanup job for old anonymous summaries
4. Test rate limiting for anonymous users

## Technical Decisions (REVISED)

### Anonymous User Tracking
- Create special "ANONYMOUS_USER" in database (no schema changes needed)
- Use browser fingerprint + localStorage + IP for tracking
- Store real session info in metadata field
- **NEW: Limit to 1 summary EVER per anonymous user**

### Modal Implementation
- Use Clerk's modal mode with custom wrapper
- Handle close/escape properly
- Show contextual messaging based on state

### Database Approach (NO MIGRATION)
- Keep userId as required (non-nullable)
- Create system user "ANONYMOUS_USER"
- All anonymous summaries assigned to this user
- Use metadata for real user tracking
- Transfer ownership by updating userId

## Type Errors to Fix
1. `ctx.req` doesn't exist - need to use `ctx.headers` for IP:
   ```typescript
   const headersList = await ctx.headers
   const clientIP = headersList.get('x-forwarded-for') || 
                    headersList.get('x-real-ip') || 
                    'unknown'
   ```
2. `userId: null` type error - need to update Prisma schema:
   ```prisma
   model Summary {
     userId       String?  // Make nullable for anonymous summaries
     // Update relation to handle nullable
     user         User?    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
   }
   ```
3. Need to handle the nullable userId throughout

## Next Steps
1. Fix the type errors in the anonymous summary creation
2. Update Prisma schema to allow nullable userId
3. Complete the frontend integration
4. Test the complete flow

## Progress Update

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Created Modal Components (✅)
**Files created:**
- `/src/components/modals/SignInModal.tsx` - Clerk integration with modal wrapper
- `/src/components/modals/AuthPromptModal.tsx` - Post-summary auth prompt

**Key features:**
- Custom close button and backdrop click handling
- ESC key support
- Proper modal styling with Clerk appearance customization
- Benefits display in auth prompt modal

#### 2. Updated Prisma Schema (✅)
**File modified:** `/prisma/schema.prisma`

**Changes:**
- Made `userId` nullable in Summary model: `userId String?`
- Updated user relation to be optional: `user User?`
- Added index on `createdAt` for cleanup queries
- Generated Prisma client with `pnpm run db:generate`

#### 3. Added Anonymous Summary API (✅)
**File modified:** `/src/server/api/routers/summary.ts`

**New procedures added:**
- `createAnonymous` - Public procedure for anonymous summary creation
- `claimAnonymous` - Protected procedure to transfer ownership
- `getAnonymous` - Public procedure to retrieve anonymous summaries

**Key implementation details:**
- IP-based rate limiting (3 summaries per hour)
- Session ID tracking for ownership verification
- Metadata storage for anonymous tracking info
- Proper error handling and validation

**Fixed issues:**
- Used `ctx.headers` instead of non-existent `ctx.req`
- Handled nullable userId throughout
- Simplified rate limiting query

### Remaining Tasks

#### 1. Update Landing Page
- Replace "Sign In" button with modal trigger
- Integrate SignInModal component
- Handle anonymous summary flow
- Add post-summary auth prompts

#### 2. Enhance URLInput Component
- Add anonymous user detection
- Generate and store session IDs
- Handle different flows for auth/anon users
- Show appropriate messaging

#### 3. Update useAuth Hook
- Add modal state management
- Add methods to open sign-in/sign-up modals
- Handle anonymous to authenticated transitions

#### 4. Update Middleware
- Allow public access to `summary.createAnonymous`
- Ensure other routes remain protected

#### 5. Testing
- Test complete flow from anonymous to authenticated
- Verify rate limiting works correctly
- Test summary claiming process
- Ensure no regression in existing auth flow

## Revised Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Anonymous User
1. Create initialization script to add ANONYMOUS_USER to database
2. Use constant ID: "ANONYMOUS_USER"
3. Set email as "anonymous@system.internal"

### Phase 2: Revert Schema & Update Procedures
1. Revert Prisma schema changes (keep userId required)
2. Update `createAnonymous` to:
   - Check localStorage for "hasUsedFreeSummary" flag
   - Verify against database (check metadata for fingerprint)
   - Assign to ANONYMOUS_USER (not null)
   - Set permanent flag after use
3. Update `claimAnonymous` to transfer from ANONYMOUS_USER
4. Implement 1-summary-ever rule

### Phase 3: Enhanced Tracking
1. Generate browser fingerprint using:
   - User agent
   - Screen resolution
   - Timezone
   - Canvas fingerprint
2. Store in localStorage AND summary metadata
3. Check both on subsequent attempts

## Next Engineer Handoff Notes

**IMPORTANT CHANGE**: We're now implementing WITHOUT database schema changes to avoid migration issues.

The approach has been revised to:
1. Use a special ANONYMOUS_USER account instead of nullable userId
2. Limit anonymous users to 1 summary EVER (not 3 per hour)
3. Track usage via browser fingerprint + localStorage

To continue:
1. Revert the Prisma schema changes
2. Create the ANONYMOUS_USER in the database
3. Update the tRPC procedures to use ANONYMOUS_USER
4. Implement browser fingerprinting for better tracking
5. Update frontend to enforce 1-summary limit

## FINAL UPDATE: UX Improvements & New Summary Limits Implemented

### ✅ Enhanced Summary Limits (August 2, 2025)

**New Limit Structure:**
- **Anonymous Users**: 1 summary ever (unchanged)
- **Free Plan**: 3 summaries ever (changed from 5/month)
- **Pro Plan**: 25 summaries/month (changed from unlimited)
- **Complete Plan**: Unlimited (unchanged)

**Implementation Details:**
- FREE plan uses total count checking (summaries ever)
- PRO plan uses monthly count checking (resets 1st of month)
- Updated all pricing configurations and database defaults
- Re-enabled usage limit enforcement in production code

### ✅ Enhanced User Experience Improvements

#### 1. **Dynamic Button States**
**File**: `/src/components/molecules/URLInput/URLInput.tsx`

- Anonymous (used): "Sign up to summarize" 
- Authenticated: "Summarize"
- Automatic auth prompt for used anonymous users

#### 2. **Enhanced Error Messages**
**Files**: `/src/server/api/routers/summary.ts`
- Anonymous: "Welcome back! You've already used your free summary. Sign up now to get 3 free summaries!"
- Free limit: "You've used all 3 of your free summaries! Upgrade to Pro for 25 summaries every month."
- Pro limit: "You've reached your monthly limit of 25 summaries. Your limit resets on the 1st of next month."

#### 3. **Success Notifications**
**File**: `/src/app/page.tsx`
- Authenticated: "✅ Summary created! Saved to your library."
- Anonymous: "✅ Free summary created! Sign up to save it to your library."
- Visual success message display with auto-dismiss

#### 4. **Smart Flow Handling**
