# Vercel Deployment Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Already Fixed

### 1. Middleware Configuration
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already configured correctly
- Middleware already excludes `/api/trpc` routes (lines 23-25 in middleware.ts)
- Auth is handled within tRPC procedures, not by middleware redirect

### 2. API Route Runtime Configuration
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already configured correctly
```typescript
// src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts
export const runtime = 'nodejs'
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
export const revalidate = 0
export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store'
```

### 3. CSP Headers
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already configured correctly
- `worker-src 'self' blob:` is present in next.config.js
- `script-src` includes `blob:` for worker scripts

### 4. tRPC Client Configuration
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already configured correctly
- Uses same-origin requests (empty string for browser)
- Includes credentials with `credentials: 'include'`

### 5. Health Check Endpoint
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already exists
- Available at `/api/trpc/health` (defined in root.ts)

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

Use the updated verification script:
```bash
# Test Vercel deployment
node scripts/verify-deployment.js https://your-app.vercel.app

# Test Railway backend (if applicable)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-api.railway.app node scripts/verify-deployment.js
```

## üìã Quick Sanity Checks

1. **tRPC Health Check**: Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/trpc/health`
   - Should return JSON, not HTML
   
2. **Check for Worker Errors**: Open browser console on your app
   - Should not see "blocked worker script" errors
   
3. **API Auth Behavior**: Test an authenticated endpoint while logged out
   - Should return JSON error, not HTML redirect

## üîç If Issues Persist

### Cookie Issues on Preview URLs
- Clerk cookies may have cross-site issues on preview URLs
- This is expected behavior for preview deployments
- Production domain should work correctly

### Clear Browser Cache
```bash
# Force refresh
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
```

### Check Vercel Logs
```bash
vercel logs --follow
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel:
- All Clerk variables (CLERK_SECRET_KEY, etc.)
- Database URLs
- API keys

## üöÄ Deployment Command
```bash
# Deploy to production
pnpm deploy

# Deploy preview
pnpm deploy:preview
```

## ‚ú® Summary

Your codebase is already properly configured for Vercel deployment. The issues you're experiencing are likely due to:

1. **Browser cache** - Clear cache and cookies
2. **Preview URL cookie restrictions** - Expected on preview URLs
3. **Environment variables** - Double-check all are set in Vercel

The middleware, runtime configuration, CSP headers, and tRPC setup are all correct. Use the verification script to validate your deployment.
