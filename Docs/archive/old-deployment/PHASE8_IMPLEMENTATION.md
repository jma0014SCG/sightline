- name: Run Phase 8 Tests
  run: |
    npm install
    node scripts/test-phase8-runner.js --report
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.CLERK_SECRET_KEY }}
    # ... other environment variables
```

### Pre-deployment Checklist
```bash
# 1. Run full test suite
node scripts/test-phase8-runner.js

# 2. Review results
cat phase8-test-results.json | jq '.summary'

# 3. Generate report
node scripts/test-phase8-runner.js --report
open phase8-test-report.html

# 4. Clean test data
node scripts/test-phase82-usage-limits.js --cleanup
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Kill existing processes
   lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
   lsof -i :8000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
   ```

2. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
   - Check database is accessible
   - Ensure connection pool isn't exhausted

3. **Test Timeouts**
   - Increase timeout values in test configs
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify services are running

4. **False Positives**
   - Run tests multiple times for consistency
   - Check for external service outages
   - Review error logs for root causes

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Run full test suite to establish baseline
2. ‚úÖ Address any failing critical systems tests
3. ‚úÖ Optimize performance bottlenecks identified
4. ‚úÖ Document any known issues or limitations

### Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] All Phase 8.1 tests passing (Critical Systems)
- [ ] All Phase 8.2 tests passing (Usage Limits)
- [ ] Phase 8.3 performance targets met (Load Testing)
- [ ] Production environment variables configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Support team briefed

### Post-Launch Monitoring
- Set up automated test runs (hourly/daily)
- Monitor real-world performance metrics
- Track usage limit enforcement
- Review error rates and patterns
- Scale infrastructure as needed

## Conclusion

Phase 8 pre-launch verification is now fully implemented with comprehensive testing coverage across all critical systems. The testing suite provides:

- **Automated verification** of all platform components
- **Performance benchmarking** against defined targets
- **Usage limit validation** for all subscription tiers
- **Load testing capabilities** for production readiness
- **Detailed reporting** for stakeholder communication

The platform can now be systematically validated before launch, with clear go/no-go criteria based on test results.
