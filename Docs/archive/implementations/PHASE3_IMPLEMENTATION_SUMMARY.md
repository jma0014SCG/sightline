## üé® Visual Improvements

### Animation Timing
- Entry animations: 200ms for smooth appearance
- Exit animations: 150ms for quick dismissal
- Hover transitions: 200ms for responsive feel
- Loading spinner: Continuous rotation

### Interactive Elements
- All clickable elements have hover states
- Visual feedback on every interaction
- Consistent animation curves (ease-in-out)
- Coordinated group animations

## üß™ Testing Checklist
