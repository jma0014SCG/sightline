# Archived Root Documentation

This directory contains root-level documentation files that have been superseded by the LLM-optimized documentation structure implemented in January 2025.

## Archived Files

### DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
**Archived**: January 9, 2025  
**Reason**: Superseded by [docs/INDEX.md](../../INDEX.md) with improved organization and LLM-friendly structure  
**Content**: Original documentation navigation hub  

### DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md  
**Archived**: January 9, 2025  
**Reason**: Excessive process overhead for LLM-optimized structure; core standards integrated into [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md)  
**Content**: Comprehensive documentation maintenance standards and workflows  

### API_DOCUMENTATION.md
**Archived**: January 9, 2025  
**Reason**: Replaced by schema-first [API/](../../../API/) directory structure with separate tRPC and FastAPI documentation  
**Content**: Complete API reference for both tRPC and FastAPI layers  

## Why These Files Were Archived

The LLM-optimized documentation structure prioritizes:

1. **Reduced File Count**: 7 core files vs. 37+ files
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminate redundancy and conflicting information  
3. **Clear Separation**: Distinct purposes for each documentation file
4. **Schema-First APIs**: Auto-generated documentation where possible
5. **Canonical Terminology**: Centralized definitions in GLOSSARY.md

## Migration Notes

### DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md → docs/INDEX.md
- Condensed from comprehensive navigation to essential paths
- Removed redundant sections and duplicate links
- Added status indicators and review schedules
- Focused on LLM consumption patterns

### DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md → Integrated Standards
- Core standards moved to CONTRIBUTING.md workflow section
- Process overhead removed for simplified maintenance
- Quality gates integrated into development workflow
- Automated validation preferred over manual processes

### API_DOCUMENTATION.md → API/ Directory
- Split into tRPC and FastAPI specific documentation  
- Added schema-first approach with auto-generation potential
- Created implementation examples directory
- Improved organization for different API consumers

## Access to Historical Content
