# SummaryViewer UI/UX Restructuring Implementation

## Overview

Transform the SummaryViewer component from a single-column document layout to an engaging two-column dashboard layout that improves content hierarchy, scannability, and user interaction.

## Implementation Date

Started: 2025-08-03

## Technical Approach

### Component Architecture

Following atomic design pattern with new molecular components:

- `ActionsSidebar` - Consolidate copy, export, share actions with clear labels  
- `KeyMomentsSidebar` - Interactive timestamp navigation with YouTube player integration
- `LearningHubTabs` - Tabbed interface for frameworks, playbooks, flashcards, glossary, quiz
- `MainContentColumn` - TL;DR and core summary content with optimized reading width

### Layout Structure

```
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 lg:gap-8">
  <div className="lg:col-span-2">
    <MainContentColumn />
  </div>
  <div className="lg:col-span-1">
    <ActionsSidebar />
    <KeyMomentsSidebar />

## Technical Implementation Details

### Grid Layout System

```typescript
// Two-column responsive grid
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 lg:gap-8">
  <div className="lg:col-span-2">
    {/* Main content takes 2/3 width on large screens */}

    {/* Sidebar takes 1/3 width on large screens */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Component Props Interface

```typescript
// Shared props pattern for all new components
interface ComponentProps {
  summary: Partial<Summary> & {
    // Extended summary data
  }
  player?: any // YouTube player instance
  playerReady?: boolean
  onTimestampClick?: (timestamp: string) => void
  className?: string
}
```
