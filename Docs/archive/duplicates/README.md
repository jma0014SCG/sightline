# Archived Duplicate Documentation

**‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHIVE PURPOSE**: This directory contains documentation files that were archived on 2025-01-09 during the documentation deduplication cleanup process.  
**üéØ Cleanup Goal**: Maintain exactly one canonical file per topic while preserving historical content.  

---

## Archive Reason

These files were identified as duplicates of content maintained authoritatively in other locations. To maintain a single source of truth and reduce documentation maintenance burden, the content has been consolidated into canonical sources listed below.

## Archived Files

### 1. platform-overview.md
- **Original Location**: `docs/architecture/platform-overview.md`
- **Size**: 1,667 lines of comprehensive platform documentation
- **Canonical Source**: [/ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Reason**: Complete duplicate of root-level architecture documentation

### 2. legacy-implementation.md
- **Consolidated Content**: Multiple legacy implementation documents
- **Original Locations**: 
  - `docs/archive/old-implementation/Implementation.md`
  - `docs/archive/old-implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- **Canonical Source**: [/docs/reports/implementation-report.md](../../reports/implementation-report.md)
- **Reason**: Outdated status reports superseded by current implementation report

## Canonical Sources Reference

| Topic | Canonical Source | Archive Reason |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| **Architecture & Design** | `/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Comprehensive technical foundation |
| **Implementation Status** | `/docs/reports/implementation-report.md` | Current completed features |
| **Testing Strategy** | `/docs/development/testing-strategy.md` | Active testing framework |

## Navigation Impact

The documentation index (`docs/INDEX.md`) has been updated to reflect this consolidation, ensuring users are directed to the canonical sources for current information.
