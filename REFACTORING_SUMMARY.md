# Summary Router Refactoring Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-16
**Branch**: chore/repo-audit

## Completed Changes

### ✅ Applied Patch and Refactoring

1. **Created `src/server/api/routers/summary/helpers.ts`**
   - Moved utility functions from main router file
   - Functions included:
     - `extractVideoId()` - Parse YouTube URLs
     - `validateYouTubeUrl()` - Validate and sanitize URLs
     - `formatSummaryContent()` - Sanitize summary content
     - `estimateTokenUsage()` - Calculate token estimates

2. **Updated `src/server/api/routers/summary.ts`**
   - Added import for helper functions
   - Removed duplicate `extractVideoId` function (lines 42-56)
   - Maintained all existing functionality

## Benefits

- **Better Code Organization**: Separated concerns into logical modules
- **Reduced File Size**: Main router file reduced by ~40 lines
- **Improved Maintainability**: Utility functions now in dedicated file
- **Easier Testing**: Helper functions can be tested independently

## File Structure

```

├── safeIntegration.ts     # Safe external API integration
├── enhanced.example.ts    # Example implementations
└── (main summary.ts imports from these modules)
```

## Pre-existing Issues (Not Related to Refactoring)

- 5 ESLint errors in other files (unescaped entities)
- Multiple TypeScript errors in test files
- Database connection warnings (Neon connection issues)

These issues existed before the refactoring and are not affected by our changes.
