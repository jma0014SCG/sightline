# YouTube API Quota Analysis

## Current API Call Cost Breakdown

Your code makes ONE API call per video:
```python
response = self.youtube_client.videos().list(
    part='snippet,statistics,contentDetails',
    id=video_id,
    fields='items(...)'
).execute()
```

### Quota Cost Calculation:
- **Base cost for `videos.list`**: 1 unit
- **`snippet` part**: 2 units
- **`statistics` part**: 2 units  
- **`contentDetails` part**: 2 units
- **TOTAL**: 7 units per video

## The Real Problem

You're requesting **TOO MANY PARTS** that you don't actually need!

### What Each Part Contains:
1. **snippet** (2 units): title, description, channelTitle, publishedAt, thumbnails
2. **statistics** (2 units): viewCount, likeCount, commentCount  
3. **contentDetails** (2 units): duration, definition, caption

### What You Actually Use:
- Title ✅ (from snippet)
- Channel name ✅ (from snippet)
- Duration ✅ (from contentDetails)
- Thumbnail ✅ (from snippet)
- View count ⚠️ (from statistics - do you display this?)
- Like count ⚠️ (from statistics - do you display this?)
- Comment count ⚠️ (from statistics - do you display this?)

## The Fix: Reduce Parts

### Option 1: Minimal (3 units per video)
Only request what's absolutely necessary:
```python
part='snippet'  # Gets title, channel, thumbnail
# Duration can be estimated or fetched via yt-dlp
```
- **Cost**: 1 (base) + 2 (snippet) = 3 units
- **Videos per day**: 3,333 videos

### Option 2: Keep Statistics (5 units per video)
If you need view/like counts:
```python
part='snippet,statistics'  # No contentDetails
# Get duration from yt-dlp instead
```
- **Cost**: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 units
- **Videos per day**: 2,000 videos

### Option 3: Optimize Fields (still 7 units but faster)
Keep all parts but optimize the fields parameter to reduce bandwidth:
```python
fields='items(snippet(title,channelTitle,thumbnails/high/url),statistics(viewCount),contentDetails(duration))'
```
- **Cost**: Still 7 units (parts determine cost, not fields)
- **Videos per day**: 1,428 videos

## Wait... Why Only 10 Videos?

If you're hitting quota with just 10 videos at 7 units each = 70 units total, something else is wrong:

### Possible Issues:
1. **Multiple API calls per video** - Check if retries are happening
2. **Other API calls** - Are you making search.list calls? (100 units each!)
3. **Shared API key** - Is the key being used elsewhere?
4. **Wrong quota calculation** - Check Google Cloud Console for actual usage

## Recommended Fix

Since your API key is currently invalid anyway, let's optimize for when you get a new one:

1. **Remove unnecessary parts** - Only request `snippet`
2. **Get duration from yt-dlp** - It's already fetching this
3. **Cache aggressively** - Store results for 24+ hours
4. **Use yt-dlp as primary** - API as fallback only
