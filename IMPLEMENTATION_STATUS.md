4. Validate performance with different video types

### Phase 2: Library Management (3-4 days)
1. Build library UI components
2. Implement search and filtering
3. Add summary management features
4. Test CRUD operations

### Phase 3: Sharing System (2-3 days)
1. Implement share link generation
2. Build public sharing pages
3. Add export functionality
4. Test sharing workflows

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (3-5 days)
1. Add comprehensive error handling
2. Implement rate limiting

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Start development servers
npm run dev:full          # Both frontend and backend
npm run dev               # Frontend only
npm run api:dev           # Backend only

# Test the pipeline
node scripts/test-pipeline.js

# Database operations
npm run db:generate       # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:migrate        # Run migrations
npm run db:push           # Push schema changes

# Environment setup
npm run env:setup         # Interactive environment setup
npm run env:validate      # Validate all environment variables
```

## 🎯 Current Capability

**What works right now:**
- User can sign in with Google
- User can paste YouTube URL
- System extracts transcript and generates AI summary
- Summary is saved to user's personal library
- Basic responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

**What's needed for MVP:**
- Library browsing and search
- Share functionality
- Performance optimization
- Error handling improvements

## 📈 Estimated Timeline to MVP

- **Current Status**: 70% complete
- **Remaining Core Work**: 10-15 days
- **Testing & Polish**: 5-7 days
- **Total to MVP**: 15-22 days

The foundation is solid and the core functionality works. The remaining work is primarily UI development and feature completion rather than complex architectural changes.
