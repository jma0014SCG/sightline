# ADR-0002: Smart Collections AI Classification System

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Users need to organize and filter their video summaries effectively. Manual tagging is time-consuming
and inconsistent. The platform generates rich content that contains identifiable entities (people,
companies, technologies) and topics that could enable intelligent organization and discovery.

## Decision

Implement an AI-powered Smart Collections system that automatically extracts and categorizes entities from video content:

### Entity Classification (7 Types)

- **PERSON**: Individuals, experts, influencers mentioned in content
- **COMPANY**: Organizations, businesses, brands referenced
- **TECHNOLOGY**: Programming languages, platforms, technical tools
- **PRODUCT**: Specific products, applications, services
- **CONCEPT**: Abstract concepts, methodologies, principles
- **FRAMEWORK**: Libraries, frameworks, development systems  
- **TOOL**: Software tools, applications, utilities

### Content Categorization (Predefined)

- 14 broad categories: Technology, Business, Marketing, Finance, Health, Productivity, etc.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Automatic Organization**: Zero user effort required for content organization
- **Enhanced Discovery**: Users can filter library by relevant tags and categories
- **Visual Organization**: Color-coded tag system for easy recognition
- **Scalable**: System improves as more content is processed
- **Search Enhancement**: Tags enable semantic search beyond text matching

### Negative Consequences

- **AI Costs**: OpenAI API calls add operational expense per summary
- **Classification Accuracy**: May misclassify entities or miss important ones
- **Processing Latency**: Adds ~2-3 seconds to summarization process
- **Model Dependency**: Reliant on OpenAI service availability and consistency

### Risks

- **API Rate Limits**: OpenAI rate limiting could impact user experience
- **Cost Scaling**: Expenses increase linearly with usage volume
- **Quality Consistency**: Classification quality may vary across different content types
- **Privacy Concerns**: Sending video content to third-party AI service

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual Tagging**: Rejected due to poor user experience and inconsistent results
- **Keyword Extraction**: Rejected as insufficient for semantic understanding
- **Local AI Models**: Rejected due to infrastructure complexity and lower quality results
- **Pre-defined Tag Lists**: Rejected as too rigid and not scalable to diverse content

## Implementation Notes

### Processing Pipeline

```text
Video Summary Generated
    ↓
OpenAI Classification (GPT-4)
    ↓
Entity Extraction + Category Assignment
    ↓
Database Storage (Tags + Categories)
    ↓
UI Display with Color Coding
```

### Error Handling Strategy

- Classification failure does not block summary creation
- Graceful degradation when OpenAI API unavailable
- Retry logic for transient API failures
- Logging for analysis and improvement

### Performance Optimization

- Parallel processing with summary generation when possible
- Caching of common entities to reduce API calls
- Batch processing for bulk classification scenarios

### UI Design Principles

- Color-coded tags for immediate visual recognition
- Expandable tag sections to prevent UI clutter
- Filter sidebar with tag counts for discovery
- Tag management interface for user overrides (future)
