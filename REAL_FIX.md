# The ACTUAL Problem and Solution

## The Real Issue

After deep analysis, the problem is that your tRPC endpoint is returning an **empty response** which causes `JSON.parse` to fail. This is happening because:

1. The backend URL might be configured but the Railway backend is **not actually accessible** from Vercel
2. OR there's a **network/firewall issue** between Vercel and Railway
3. OR the backend is returning an error with an empty body

## Immediate Debug Steps

### 1. Test the Debug Endpoint
Visit this URL in your browser:
```
https://sightlineai.io/api/test-backend
```

This will show you:
- What backend URL is configured
- If the backend is reachable from Vercel
- The actual error messages

### 2. Check Vercel Function Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on "Functions" tab
3. Look for errors in `/api/trpc/[trpc]` logs
4. You'll see the ACTUAL error that's happening server-side

### 3. The Most Likely Issues

#### Issue A: Railway Backend is Down/Sleeping
Railway free tier puts services to sleep. Check:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Is your service running?
3. Click "Deploy" if it's sleeping
4. Wait for "Application startup complete"

#### Issue B: Network Connectivity
Vercel might not be able to reach Railway. Test:
1. SSH into your Railway service (if possible)
2. Check if it's receiving ANY requests from Vercel
3. Look at Railway logs for incoming connections

#### Issue C: Database Connection Failed
The tRPC endpoint might be failing because Prisma can't connect to the database:
1. Check if `DATABASE_URL` is set in Vercel
2. Make sure it points to your Neon database
3. The connection string should look like:
   ```
   postgresql://user:pass@host.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
   ```

## The Nuclear Option (Quick Fix)

### Deploy Backend to Vercel Instead
Since your frontend is on Vercel, put the Python API there too:

1. Create `/api/python-proxy/route.ts`:
```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const body = await request.json()
    
    // Call your Railway backend or run the logic directly here
    const response = await fetch('https://sightline-api-production.up.railway.app/api/summarize', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(body)
    })
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      // If Railway is down, return a mock response for testing
      return NextResponse.json({
        task_id: 'test-' + Date.now(),
        video_url: body.url,
        video_title: 'Test Video',
        summary: 'Backend is currently unavailable',
        // ... other required fields
      })
    }
    
    const data = await response.json()
    return NextResponse.json(data)
  } catch (error) {
    // Return mock data to keep the app working
    return NextResponse.json({
      task_id: 'mock-' + Date.now(),
      error: 'Backend temporarily unavailable'
    })
  }
}
```

2. Update the backend client to use this proxy in production

## The Real Real Fix

### Check These Environment Variables in Vercel:

1. **DATABASE_URL** - Must be set to your Neon database
2. **NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL** - Must be set to Railway URL
3. **BACKEND_URL** - Also set this for server-side

### Then Check Railway:

1. Is the service actually running?
2. Are all Python dependencies installed?
3. Is the database accessible from Railway?
4. Are the API keys (OpenAI, Gumloop) set?

### Common Railway Issues:

1. **Service Sleeping**: Free tier sleeps after 30 min inactivity
2. **Build Failed**: Check deployment logs for Python errors
3. **Port Binding**: Make sure it's listening on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Check `requirements.txt` is complete

## Test After Changes

Run this command locally:
```bash
curl -X POST https://sightlineai.io/api/test-backend
```

You should see:
- Backend URL that's configured
- Test results for health and summarize endpoints
- Specific error messages if something fails

## If All Else Fails

The app is trying to work but can't reach the backend. Either:
1. Fix the Railway deployment
2. Move the Python logic to Vercel
3. Use a different hosting service (Render, Fly.io, etc.)

The frontend code is fine. The issue is **backend connectivity**.
