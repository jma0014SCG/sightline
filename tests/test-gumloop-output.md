## Video Context

**Title**: *Free Revit Beginner Mini-Course – Project 1 (House Model from Scratch)*  
**Speakers**: Mladen ("Balkan Architect")  
**Duration**: 37:42  
**Channel**: Balkan Architect  
**Synopsis**: Build a complete residential house model in Revit from scratch, covering walls, doors, roofs, dimensions, and visual presentation.

## Key Moments

- **00:45** → Why custom templates beat Revit stock templates for speed & cleanliness.  
- **05:22** → Trick: Draw walls clockwise for exterior face alignment without manual flips.  

---

## Strategic Frameworks

| Step | Principle | Why it Matters |
|------|-----------|----------------|
|1|Template First|Pre-loaded families save 10+ mins/project|
|2|Clockwise Drawing|Auto-aligns exterior faces correctly|

---

## Playbooks & Heuristics

- **If** you can't see a control panel → View ▶ User Interface→toggle Project Browser/Properties.  
- **When** placing doors → Tab through wall layers before clicking for precision control.

---

## Insight Enrichment

- Tools: `WA`(Wall), `TR`(Trim/Extend), `AL`(Align Dimension), `CS`(Create Similar).  
- Risk: forget to attach walls to roof = manual cleanup later.

### Feynman Flashcards

1. **Q**: Why set levels before modeling? **A**: They're datums; every height-based edit references them.
2. **Q**: What's the Underlay trick? **A**: See upper-floor walls in grey while modeling ground level.

---

### Glossary

**Underlay** – A view setting that shows geometry from another level as a grey reference.  
**Place on Face** – Tool for hosting families (e.g., dormers) directly on angled surfaces.
