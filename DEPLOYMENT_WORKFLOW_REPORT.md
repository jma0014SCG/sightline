## üö® Critical Issue Discovered

**Problem**: Next.js is not detecting the app directory and only building pages routes (404 page).

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Symptom**: All routes return 404 on deployed site
- **Cause**: `app-paths-manifest.json` is empty - Next.js isn't detecting app router
- **Impact**: No app routes are being generated during build

### Evidence
1. Build output only shows "Route (pages)" not "Route (app)"
2. `.next/server/app-paths-manifest.json` contains `{}`
3. Only 2 static pages generated (404 and error pages)
4. App directory exists with valid files but not being processed

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Linking
- **Status**: SUCCESS
- **Details**: Linked to correct Vercel project
- **Project ID**: prj_zZOMbockh3Tjwa0w8t1p5LfPSU7c
- **Team ID**: team_bxSaVONmmbbnaDLEV0yMeaI3

### 2. Backend Deployment
- **Status**: SUCCESS
- **URL**: https://sightline-ai-backend-production.up.railway.app
- **Health**: API responding at `/api/health`

### 3. Frontend Deployment Attempts
- **Status**: PARTIAL SUCCESS
- **Issue**: Deployments successful but app routes not working
- **Latest**: https://sightline-93d5yqt3x-jma0014-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app

## üîß Configuration Changes Applied

### Next.js Config
- Removed `webpackBuildWorker` and `serverMinification` from experimental
- Removed `output: 'standalone'` that might conflict with Vercel

### Vercel Config
- Simplified to minimal configuration
- Added explicit `buildCommand: "next build"`
- Removed invalid properties from previous attempts

## üö´ Blocking Issue

**Next.js is not building app router routes**. This needs to be resolved before the site can function.

### Potential Solutions to Try

1. **Force App Router Mode**
   ```javascript
   // Add to next.config.js
   experimental: {
     appDir: true
   }
   ```

2. **Check for Conflicting Files**
   - Look for any `pages` directory that might exist
   - Check for _app.js or _document.js files

3. **Version Compatibility**
   - Current: Next.js 14.2.31
   - May need to upgrade or downgrade

4. **Clean Install**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules .next
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   ```

## üìã Remaining Tasks

1. **Fix App Router Detection** (BLOCKER)
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel
3. Verify site functionality
4. Configure custom domain (sightlineai.io)
5. Complete documentation

## üéØ Next Steps

The critical issue is that Next.js isn't detecting the app directory. This must be resolved before proceeding with deployment.

### Recommended Actions
1. Investigate why Next.js is defaulting to pages router
2. Try forcing app directory mode
3. Consider creating a minimal test with just one route
4. Check for any configuration conflicts

## üìä Deployment Metrics
- Total deployment attempts: 10+
- Backend status: ‚úÖ Operational
- Frontend status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Deployed but non-functional
- Configuration iterations: 5+
