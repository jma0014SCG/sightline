## What

Sightline.ai converts YouTube videos into structured summaries featuring:

- **Instant AI Summaries** - TL;DR, key moments, frameworks, and playbooks extracted from video content
- **Smart Collections** - Automatic tagging with 7 entity types
  (Person, Company, Technology, Product, Concept, Framework, Tool)
- **Anonymous Trial** - Try with 1 free summary, no signup required
- **Real-time Progress** - Live processing updates with accurate stage tracking
- **Personal Library** - Searchable collection with intelligent filtering
- **Public Sharing** - Generate shareable links for any summary

## Why

**Problem**: YouTube videos contain valuable insights buried in hours of content,
making knowledge extraction time-consuming and inconsistent.

**Solution**: AI-powered analysis that converts video content into structured, searchable, and actionable formats.

**Value**:

- Save 90% of time typically spent watching educational content
- Never lose track of valuable insights from videos
- Organize knowledge with intelligent, automatic categorization
- Share discoveries easily with teammates and communities

## How

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your API keys to .env.local (see Environment Setup guide)

# Database setup
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push

# Start development servers
pnpm dev:full  # Both frontend (3000) and backend (8000)
```

### Essential Commands
