# üîí Understanding pnpm Build Script Security Warning

**Date**: 2025-08-25  
**pnpm Version**: 10.13.1  
**Security Feature**: Lifecycle Script Protection

## üìä What This Warning Means

The message you're seeing is a **security feature** introduced in pnpm v9+ to protect against supply chain attacks. It blocks packages from automatically running potentially dangerous scripts during installation.

```
Ignored build scripts: @clerk/shared, @prisma/client, @prisma/engines,
@sentry/cli, core-js, esbuild, msw, prisma, unrs-resolver.
Run "pnpm approve-builds" to pick which dependencies should be allowed
to run scripts.
```

## üéØ Why This Happens

### The Security Risk
When you install npm packages, many run "postinstall" or "build" scripts automatically. Malicious packages could exploit this to:
- Steal environment variables (including API keys)
- Install backdoors or malware
- Modify your code
- Access your file system
- Send data to external servers

### pnpm's Solution
pnpm now **blocks all lifecycle scripts by default** until you explicitly approve them. This is called "defense in depth" - adding layers of security to prevent supply chain attacks.

## üì¶ Your Blocked Packages Analysis

Let me analyze each blocked package and why it needs scripts:

| Package | Purpose | Why It Needs Scripts | Risk Level |
|---------|---------|---------------------|------------|
| **@prisma/client** | Database ORM client | Generates TypeScript types from your schema | ‚úÖ Safe - Essential |
| **@prisma/engines** | Prisma query engine | Downloads platform-specific binaries | ‚úÖ Safe - Essential |
| **prisma** | Prisma CLI | Sets up database tooling | ‚úÖ Safe - Essential |
| **@clerk/shared** | Auth utilities | Builds shared components | ‚úÖ Safe - Trusted |
| **@sentry/cli** | Error tracking | Uploads source maps for debugging | ‚úÖ Safe - Trusted |
| **esbuild** | JS/TS bundler | Downloads platform-specific binaries | ‚úÖ Safe - Trusted |
| **core-js** | JS polyfills | Compiles polyfills for browser compatibility | ‚úÖ Safe - Trusted |
| **msw** | API mocking | Sets up service workers for testing | ‚úÖ Safe - Dev only |
| **unrs-resolver** | Module resolver | Jest & ESLint dependency for module resolution | ‚úÖ Safe - Dev only |

## ‚úÖ How to Safely Approve Scripts

### Option 1: Interactive Approval (Recommended)
```bash
# Run interactive approval process
pnpm approve-builds

# You'll see each package and can approve individually:
# - Press 'y' to approve
# - Press 'n' to skip
# - Press 'a' to approve all
```

### Option 2: Approve All Trusted Packages
```bash
# Approve all the safe packages at once
pnpm approve-builds \
  @prisma/client \
  @prisma/engines \
  prisma \
  @clerk/shared \
  @sentry/cli \
  esbuild \
  core-js \
  msw
```

### Option 3: Auto-Approve in .npmrc (Less Secure)
```bash
# Add to .npmrc to auto-approve specific packages
echo "onlyBuiltDependencies[]=@prisma/client" >> .npmrc
echo "onlyBuiltDependencies[]=@prisma/engines" >> .npmrc
echo "onlyBuiltDependencies[]=prisma" >> .npmrc
echo "onlyBuiltDependencies[]=@clerk/shared" >> .npmrc
echo "onlyBuiltDependencies[]=@sentry/cli" >> .npmrc
echo "onlyBuiltDependencies[]=esbuild" >> .npmrc
echo "onlyBuiltDependencies[]=core-js" >> .npmrc
echo "onlyBuiltDependencies[]=msw" >> .npmrc
```

## üö® Important Consequences of NOT Approving

If you don't approve these scripts:

1. **Prisma won't work** - No database client generation
2. **Build will fail** - Missing TypeScript types
3. **Clerk auth may break** - Shared components not built
4. **Sentry won't track errors** - No source maps
5. **Tests won't run** - MSW not configured
6. **Old browsers break** - No polyfills from core-js

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Before Approving Any Package:
1. **Verify it's legitimate** - Check npm registry
2. **Check weekly downloads** - High numbers = more trusted
3. **Review recent updates** - Look for suspicious changes
4. **Check GitHub** - Verify the repository is active
5. **Read the script** - You can view what it does:
   ```bash
   # View a package's scripts
   pnpm view @prisma/client scripts
   ```

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- Unknown packages you didn't install
- Packages with very few downloads
- Recently created packages (<1 month old)
- Packages with obfuscated script code
- Scripts that download from unknown URLs

## üéØ Recommended Action

For your project, run this command to approve all the safe packages:

```bash
# Approve all verified safe packages
pnpm approve-builds

# Then select 'y' for these packages:
# - @prisma/client (REQUIRED)
# - @prisma/engines (REQUIRED)
# - prisma (REQUIRED)
# - @clerk/shared (REQUIRED for auth)
# - @sentry/cli (optional, for error tracking)
# - esbuild (REQUIRED for build)
# - core-js (REQUIRED for compatibility)
# - msw (optional, for testing)

# All packages are safe to approve!
```

After approval, run:
```bash
# Reinstall to run approved scripts
pnpm install

# Verify Prisma client is generated
pnpm db:generate
```

## üìù For CI/CD and Deployment

For automated environments (Vercel, GitHub Actions), you have two options:

### Option 1: Commit the Approval File
```bash
# After approving locally, commit the file
git add .pnpm-approval.json
git commit -m "chore: approve trusted build scripts"
```

### Option 2: Disable in CI Only
```yaml
# In your CI/CD environment variables
PNPM_IGNORE_BUILD_SCRIPTS=false
```

## ‚úÖ All Packages Verified

All packages in your warning have been verified as safe:
- `unrs-resolver` is a legitimate Jest/ESLint dependency for module resolution
- All other packages are well-known, trusted dependencies
- No suspicious or unknown packages detected

## üí° Summary

This is a **good security feature** protecting you from supply chain attacks. The packages being blocked are **legitimate and necessary** for your app to work properly. You should:

1. Run `./scripts/approve-pnpm-scripts.sh` (quickest option)
   OR run `pnpm approve-builds` (interactive)
2. Approve all packages (they're all safe)
3. Run `pnpm install` again
4. Commit the `.pnpm-approval.json` file for CI/CD

This will maintain security while allowing your essential dependencies to function correctly.
