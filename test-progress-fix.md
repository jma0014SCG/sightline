# Progress Bar Fix Test Plan

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Progress Completion
- Updated simulated progress to reach 100% (was capped at 95%)
- Progress hook now properly triggers completion status at 100%
- Added completion callback when reaching 100% in simulation

### 2. Immediate Summary Display
- Removed the `waitForProgressCompletion` function that was causing delays
- Summary now displays immediately when received from backend
- Progress tracking is stopped (task ID cleared) when summary is displayed

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Added user-friendly error messages instead of alerts
- Error messages appear as notifications that auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Different messages for network errors vs limit errors

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Anonymous User Summary Creation
1. Open the app in incognito/private browser
2. Paste a YouTube URL
3. Observe:
   - Progress bar should start immediately
   - Progress should reach 100%
   - Summary should display as soon as it's ready
   - Progress bar should disappear when summary appears

### Test 2: Authenticated User Summary Creation
1. Sign in to the app
2. Paste a YouTube URL
3. Observe:
   - Same behavior as anonymous
   - Progress reaches 100%
   - Summary displays immediately when ready

### Test 3: Error Handling
1. Try to create a summary with invalid URL
2. Observe error message appears as notification
3. Try as anonymous user after using free summary
4. Observe appropriate limit message

## Expected Behavior

✅ Progress bar reaches 100% during processing
✅ Summary displays immediately when backend returns it
✅ Progress bar disappears once summary is shown
✅ Error messages are user-friendly and informative
✅ No stuck progress at 67% or other percentages

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/page.tsx`
   - Removed `waitForProgressCompletion` function
   - Clear task ID immediately when summary is received
   - Better error messages using `setSuccessMessage`

2. `/src/lib/hooks/useProgressTracking.ts`
   - Fixed simulation to reach 100% (was 95%)
   - Added completion callback when reaching 100%
   - Fixed stage index calculation

## Backend Coordination

The backend sets progress to 100% when summary is ready (line 226 in api/index.py):
```python
await progress_storage.set_progress(task_id, {"progress": 100, "stage": "Summary ready!", "status": "completed", "task_id": task_id, "cid": cid})
```

Frontend now properly handles this by:
1. Displaying the summary immediately
2. Clearing the task ID to stop progress tracking
3. Hiding the progress bar
